## Project Motivation
The idea behind this project was to identify what are the top software skills that are gaining / loosing popularity among the developers through the years. What skills are getting paid the most and what skills satisfy developers the most. All of this is done so it can be helpful in making decisions when trying to learn new skils.
I have chosen Stackoverfow's annual survey data from the year 2017 to the year 2020 for this analysis.
The questions that i have tried to answer are:
- What Programming Languages, Databases and Platforms are desirable and gaining in popularity over the years.
- What Language, Database and Platform skill earns you the most.
- What is the job satisfaction level of a developer using a particular Language, Database and Platform over the years.
